# Groups Tab Loading Performance Fix

## Issue Fixed
The Groups tab was taking a long time to load because the `PatientGroupsTab` component was fetching patient groups data every time the tab was clicked, instead of loading it once with the dashboard.

## Root Cause
- `PatientGroupsTab` had its own data fetching logic with `useEffect` that ran on every mount
- When users clicked the Groups tab, it triggered a fresh API call to `/api/patient-groups`
- This caused a noticeable delay and loading state each time

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Moved Patient Groups to Dashboard State
- Added `PatientGroup` type to `/src/types/index.ts`
- Added `patientGroups` state to the main dashboard component
- Updated `fetchData()` to include patient groups in the initial data fetch

### 2. Updated PatientGroupsTab Component
- **Removed internal data fetching**: Eliminated `fetchPatientGroups`, `useEffect`, and `loading` state
- **Props-based data**: Now receives `patientGroups` data and `setPatientGroupsAction` function as props
- **Local state updates**: All CRUD operations now update local state instead of refetching data

### 3. Optimized CRUD Operations
- **Add Group**: `setPatientGroupsAction(prev => [newGroup, ...prev])`
- **Update Group**: `setPatientGroupsAction(prev => prev.map(...))`
- **Delete Group**: `setPatientGroupsAction(prev => prev.filter(...))`

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- ✅ **Instant Tab Loading**: Groups tab now loads instantly with no API calls
- ✅ **Single Data Fetch**: Patient groups data is fetched only once on dashboard mount
- ✅ **Immediate UI Updates**: All group operations update the UI instantly

### User Experience
- ✅ **No Loading Delays**: Clicking the Groups tab shows data immediately
- ✅ **Smooth Navigation**: Consistent with other dashboard tabs (Patients, Templates)
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Changes to groups appear instantly without refetching

## Technical Details

### Before
```tsx
// PatientGroupsTab had its own data fetching
const [patientGroups, setPatientGroups] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  fetchPatientGroups(); // API call on every tab switch
}, []);
```

### After
```tsx
// PatientGroupsTab receives data as props
interface PatientGroupsTabProps {
  patientGroups: PatientGroup[];
  setPatientGroupsAction: React.Dispatch<...>;
}

// No internal fetching - data comes from parent
```

## Files Modified

1. **`/src/types/index.ts`**: Added `PatientGroup` type definition
2. **`/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**: 
   - Added patient groups to main state and fetchData
   - Pass groups data as props to PatientGroupsTab
3. **`/src/components/dashboard/PatientGroupsTab.tsx`**:
   - Removed internal data fetching logic
   - Updated to use props-based data
   - Modified CRUD operations to use local state updates

## Result
The Groups tab now loads as fast as other dashboard tabs, providing a consistent and responsive user experience across the entire dashboard.
